# Functional Programming

Functional Programming is a functional programming language class using cafeobj (https://cafeobj.org/intro/ja/). As a feature, programs are treated as terms, and reduction using pattern matching is performed on the terms. The course includes algorithms, infinite lists, generics, a small programming language called minilla (interpreter, compiler, virtual machine), and finally formal proofs using mathematical functional methods to prove equality between functions.
